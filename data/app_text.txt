_*''How disordered does a potential have be for the system to retain local memory.''* -P. W. Anderson 1958_

We propose **dimension analysis via 2NN** (a neighbour graphs algorithm) can help to answer this question. To show our method we present and interactive tool for analysis of **Hubbard Hamiltonian eigenstates**.

$$\mathcal{H} = t\sum_i^{L-1}(\hat{c}_{i+1}^\dagger \hat{c}_i +h.c.) 
            + U\sum_{i}^{L-1} \hat{n}_i\hat{n}_{i+1}
            + \sum_{i}^L h_i\hat{n}_i.$$

Each site is associated with an energy. This ernergy is drawn from uniform random distribution in the range [-W,W]

Do note, that the x-axis postion for the potential is not the same as that for the eigvecs. For the potential, it is the site number, whereas for the eigenstates it is the configuration index. The configurations are indexed as follows

2 nearest neighbours (2nn) looks at the manhattan (L1) distance to nearest neighbours. Since L1 distance scales with dimensionality of the gradient -- this is really what we are measuring. To obtain $\mu$ we divide the next nearest neighbour distance, $r_2$, by the nearest neighbour distance, $r_1$. The reason we use two rather than just one, is for the algorithm to be generally applicable, i.e., $r_1$ is used to scale for local density. On the second axis, $F(\mu)$ is the emperical cumulate. An origin-bound linear fit, has a slope that estimates the intrinsic dimension of the data-sample.
