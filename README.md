# Many-body Localization - Intrinsic Dimension


We investigate the intrinsic dimension across the many-body localization transition as a means of identification. We obtain intrinsic dimension via 2NN, a neighbour graphs algorithm. Using scaling collapse we are able to determine the critical parameter value.

See IDMBL.ipynb for code along (this can be run on a laptop)
